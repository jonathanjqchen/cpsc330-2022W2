# CPSC 330 grading policies

## Grading
 
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component                                                                               | Weight          | Location   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Syllabus quiz                                                                           |   1%           | Canvas | 
| [Assignments](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2022W2#deliverable-due-dates-tentative) |     30%         | Gradescope |
| Midterm                                                                                 |     19%         | Canvas |
| Final                                                                                   |     50%         | Canvas |

- **A score of at least 50% in the Final Exam is required to pass the course.**
- For the weight of each homework assignment, see the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2022W2#deliverable-due-dates-tentative).
- Your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

## General guidelines
- All grading concerns and challenges must be submitted to Michelle, your CPSC 330 course coordinator ([cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca](cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca)) for review. 
- Clearly state your name, student number, the assessment, and your concern.

## Grading concerns: time limit
If you perceive a problem with your homework or exam grade, you have **one week** to raise a concern from the time that your grades were posted. After that, your grade is final.

## Reasonable grading concerns
Grades are not perfect; some randomness in grading is normal, meaning that you'll generally get more than you deserve in some cases and less than you deserve in other cases. Thus, it is possible to exploit the system by consistently complaining when your grade is too low but not when it is too high. Unfortunately, this takes time away from the course staff which could have been spent on making the course better for everyone. Thus, in my view, students who overzealously contest grades are penalizing their classmates for personal gain.

Sometimes serious grading errors are made, for example when a grader did not see your answer to a question or completely deviated from standard grading practices. Such situations can be quite frustrating for students, and we want you to feel that the course is fair. In these cases, it makes sense for the student to bring the error to our attention.

We appreciate that minor grade differences (+/- 1 point) are not uncommon, hence they won't be considered for regrading. However, we kindly request that students avoid submitting multiple regrade requests for minor issues or contesting decisions. Please note that continually submitting unreasonable regrade requests for assignments and exams may result in the loss of the privilege to request grade challenges for the remainder of the course.
